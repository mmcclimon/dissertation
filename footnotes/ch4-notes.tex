  \cite{russell:lcc}. References to the book in this dissertation will be to
  this final edition (Russell died in 2009) unless otherwise noted. Though a
  full reception history of the \emph{Lydian Chromatic Concept} is beyond the
  scope of this project, it is worth noting that the later editions focus more
  heavily on the theory than the earlier editions, which were more practical
  in nature. In the original edition, the section on theoretical foundations
  appears after eight initial ``lessons''; in the 2001 edition, this material
  has been moved front and center, to Chapter 1.\nocite{russell:1959}}

  \cite{tymoczko:1997}; and \headlesscite[366n13]{tymoczko:2011}. My intent
  here is not to single out Tymoczko, but only to note that modern theorists
  who engage directly with Russell's ideas do not always mention his work. The
  most complete treatments of the \emph{Concept} in modern scholarship are
  Burt's previously-cited article on Takemitsu and Brett Clement's work on
  Frank Zappa (who, while influenced by jazz, is not part of the jazz
  mainstream that is the focus of this study); see \headlesscite{clement:2014}.}

  I am using the term ``scale'' here as Russell does: he always refers to the
  Lydian as a scale rather than a mode. Dmitri Tymoczko has argued against
  this usage, saying that there is a ``widespread tendency to elide the
  difference between scale and
  mode'' \parentext{\citetitle[366n14]{tymoczko:2011}}. To call the Lydian a mode
  would imply that it is simply a reordering of a major scale, though, and for
  Russell the two are fundamentally different objects.}

  Russell does not mention that this chord sounds dissonant because of the
  minor ninth between F\nat\ and E, the third of the chord. In the \h{CM7s11}
  chord the minor ninth is turned into a major seventh between G and F\sharp,
  which is much more easily accepted as a consonance---especially in jazz.}
