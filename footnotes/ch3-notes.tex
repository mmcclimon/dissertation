%% Chapter 3 notes

\fntext{mts-1}{%
  Turning Figure \ref{mts:m3-torus} into a torus involves gluing the
  top and bottom edges together and the left and right edges together; the
  dotted line representing perfect fifths then wraps around the surface of the
  torus in a continuous line (as though you had wrapped a barber's pole into a
  doughnut).}
