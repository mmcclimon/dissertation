\section{Problems of Jazz Analysis}
\label{sec:problems-jazz-analysis} %{{{

When compared to a score by Beethoven (for example), the jazz lead sheet appears
strikingly bare. The Beethoven score specifies nearly everything a performer
needs to know in order to perform it. Though the minor details (dynamics,
articulations, phrasing marks, and the like) will differ from piece to piece,
we can usually depend on the presence of some basic information. It is rare for
traditional scores not to include the instrumentation, for example, and a score
that did not include information like the number of measures or which notes to
play in combination with which which other notes would be very unusual indeed.

And yet, this is the usual state affairs for the jazz lead sheet, which is
probably the most common form of a “jazz score.”\fn{pja-1} Most lead sheets only
include the basic outline of a melody along with a set of “changes” that
prescribe the harmonic structure of a piece. Beyond this most basic instruction,
every other aspect is left up to the performers. Given that most small-group
jazz musicians approach the music first with these lead sheets, it seems
appropriate to focus our analytical attention on harmony, the more salient of
those two elements.

Jazz is essentially a harmonic music. In a typical jazz performance, the melody
of the piece is only heard twice (at the beginning and the end), while the
harmonic structure is heard throughout, determining the structure of the
performance. Each soloist typically plays one or more “choruses,” where each
chorus is understood as a single iteration of the pieces harmonic structure.
In marked contrast to a Beethoven score, jazz compositions usually remain
unspecified when it comes to their contrapuntal structure: performers will
typically improvise counterpoint that fits with the underlying harmonic
framework. Harmony is the main restraining factor of a piece, and its primary
method of coherence.

The word “jazz”---which has been used at various times to describe McKinney’s
Cotton Pickers, Benny Goodman, Sun Ra, John Zorn, Tito Puente, and Brad
Mehldau, among many others---is inescapably vague, so it will be useful at
this point to delimit the terms of this study somewhat. Here I am interested
in in what might be called “tonal jazz,” which begins in the swing area and
continues through hard bop, covering roughly the years 1935--1965. In this
music, functional harmonic progressions are still the norm; “tonal jazz” is
meant in opposition to “modal jazz,” where the rate of harmonic change is
slower and the harmony is mostly non-functional.\fn{pja-2} This includes much
of the music that most people think of when they hear the word “jazz,”
including big-band swing (Count Basie, much of Duke Ellington’s music), bebop
(Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk), and the mainstream jazz
that followed bebop, known variously as “hard bop” or “post-bop” (John
Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Bill Evans, and many others). I intend the dates to
be flexible, especially on the later end; given the strong influence of the
bebop tradition on jazz and jazz pedagogy, the hard bop style continued to
exist well beyond 1965, and many players today still play in the style.

Now that we have dilineated “jazz,” we should explain exactly what we mean by
“harmony.” Harmony is of course one of the oldest topics in music theory, and
as such has been hotly contested throughout its history. It is often
found in opposition to couterpoint; in this view, counterpoint is concerned
with individual melodic voices, while harmony is concerned with individual
verticalities. In other traditions (most notably the Schenkerian tradition),
harmony is understood to be an outgrowth of counterpoint: verticalities arise
primarily through contrapuntal procedures. Furthermore, study of harmony is
often broken down by genre: “tonal harmony” plays a different role than does
“chromatic harmony” in both theoretical research and pedagogy.

When jazz musicians refer to “harmony,” they are typically referring to the
changes themselves, that is, the chord symbols given on a lead sheet or
arrangement. Even when they are not playing from sheet music, the chord symbol
is the basic unit of harmonic understanding for jazz musicians. The reason for
this is largly practical: a chord symbol is a concise way of referring to a
particular sound, and improvising musicians must be able to understand this
information quickly (when reading) and to recall it easily (when improvising).

% rewrite? {
Since the pioneering work of George Russell in the late 1950s, many jazz%{{{
musicians conceive of an equivalence between a harmony (a chord symbol) and a
scale.\footcite{russell:lcc} The chord symbol \h{Dm7} might imply a D dorian
scale, for example, rather than simply the notes D--F--A--C. Because any of
the notes of this scale will sound relatively good over a \h{Dm7} chord, the
chord symbol makes a convenient shorthand for a particular “way of playing.”
This equivalence between chords and scales will be the focus of chapter 4; for
now it enough to note that understanding jazz harmony often involves more than
understanding relationships between four-voice seventh chords.
%}%}}}

When analyzing jazz harmony, it is often difficult to determine exactly what
one should be analyzing. Lead sheets as circulated in fake books can be highly
inaccurate, and often cannot be relied upon as a single source for any
particular jazz performance, since it is rare that performers play directly
from a lead sheet with no modifications.\fn{pja-3a} In the case of jazz
standards which may have originated elsewhere, we might wonder whether should
we analyze the original sources. In many cases, however, the “jazz standard”
version may be significantly different from the original version, reflecting a
history of adaptation by generations of jazz musicians.\fn{pja-3b} To make
matters worse, this knowledge is often secret knowledge, not written down and
learned only from more experienced musicians.

Many published jazz analyses rely on transcriptions of particular performances
as a way to avoid some of these issues. In general, this solution works well,
and I will certainly make use of them from time to time. This study, however,
is interested in harmony more generally, and transcriptions can confuse
matters somewhat. The kinds of questions I am interested in answering are of
the type “What can we say about harmony in the piece ‘Autumn Leaves’?” and
less often of the type “What can we say about Bill Evans’s use of harmony in
the recording of ‘Autumn Leaves’ from \emph{Portrait in Jazz}?” Furthermore,
even transcriptions are not definitive when it comes to harmony: the pianist
and guitarist might not be playing the same chord; the soloist might have a
different harmony in mind than the rhythm section; or the bass player might
play a bass line in such a way that affects our perception of the chordal
root. Even in the course of a single performance, a group might alter a tune’s
harmonic progression, perhaps preferring some substitutions during solos and
others during the head.

This is a problem without one clear solution, and it may make more sense to
use one method or another depending on the situation. Some compositions have
canonical recordings---Coleman Hawkins’s recording of “Body and Soul,” for
example---and in those circumstances determining the changes is usually
unproblematic. Other compositions are more fluid, and different choruses might
alter the basic structure throughout (substituting a \h{V7b9} for a \h{V13s11}
chord, for example).  In these cases, I am interested in what Henry Martin has
called the “ideal changes”; a hypothetical set of chords that we can use as a
basis for understanding the many variations that might occur in actual
performance.\fn{pja-3c} These changes represent a sort of Platonic model of a
composition; individual performances of “Autumn Leaves” can be seen as
instances of some ideal “\textsc{Autumn Leaves}.” Determining these ideal
changes is often a process of mediating published lead sheets, recorded
versions, and other sources; throughout this study I have tried to clarify
exactly \emph{what} harmony I am analyzing in any given example.


In an attempt to answer some of these problems, this dissertation presents a
transformational model of jazz harmony. While on the surface a
transformational model may seem abstract and far-removed from the concerns of
performing jazz musicians, harmony in jazz fits together nicely with David
Lewin’s famous “transformational attitude.”\footcite[][159 (hereafter
\emph{GMIT)}]{lewin:gmit} A jazz
musician does not typically think of harmonies as a series of points in space,
but rather as a series of “characteristic gestures” between them. Rather than
focusing on an underlying tonality, a jazz musician often tries to “make the
changes”---to fully engage with the sound of each individual harmony.

There is often quite a large gap between the way jazz is most commonly taught
(in jazz studios and pedagogical books) and the way it has traditionally been
understood by music theorists. Another goal of the present study is to use
transformational methods in an attempt to narrow this gap, by bringing
theoretical and mathematical rigor to materials that are often ignored by the
theory community, and by applying established theoretical principles in a way
that corresponds closely with the understanding of jazz musicians.

While we can never claim to know “what jazz musicians think,” we might get
somewhat closer to an answer by examining jazz pedagogical materials. In the
late 1960s, jazz began to be accepted into the academy, and many young jazz
musicians began to learn to play the music in schools, rather than exclusively
from older musicians.\fn{pja-4} To supplement this teaching, a great deal of
pedagogical material has appeared that aims to teach young musicians how to
play jazz.

Unfortunately, there is little interaction between these pedagogical materials
and music theoretical materials. Pedagogical materials, such as the recent
\emph{Berklee Book of Jazz Harmony}\nocite{berklee:harmony}, often do not have
bibliographies or mention recent work in the theoretical literature.\fn{pja-5}
Likewise, most theoretical work does not refer to these harmonic handbooks
which are staples of jazz education. Mark Levine’s \emph{Jazz Theory
Book}\nocite{levine:1995}, widely regarded in the jazz education world as
\emph{the} book on jazz theory, does not appear in any of the bibliographies
in the special jazz issue of \emph{Music Theory Online} (18.3), for example.

In recent years the theory community has embraced pedagogical materials as a
means of uncovering how historical musicians might have thought about their
own music.\fn{pja-6} Though jazz pedagogues do not typically publish articles
in music theory journals or otherwise consider themselves “music theorists,”
per se, the goal of their harmonic textbooks is quite similar to the goals of
pedagogical books in music theory: to teach students how to think in a
particular style of music.

David Lewin points out in his introduction to transformational theory that
when considering a particular musical passage, we often “conceptualize along
with it, as one of its characteristic textural features, a family of directed
measurements, distances, or motions of some sort.”\footcite[16]{lewin:gmit} I
certainly hear these characteristic motions when I listen to jazz, and I think
it is these motions that jazz pedagogues are emphasizing when they
teach students to “make the changes.” Despite its somewhat hostile
mathematical appearance, transformational theory is an effective means of
exploring these families of intuitions. Modeling sets of chord changes as
transformations between harmonic objects, for example, allows the theoretical
discourse to draw on the ways in which jazz musicians teach harmony, and can
bring these two disparate fields somewhat closer together.

\section{Theoretical Approaches to Jazz Harmony}
\label{sec:theoretical-approaches} %{{{

Studies of jazz harmony in recent years have primarily taken the form of
Schenkerian analyses that seek to uncover large-scale voice-leading structures
in order to define tonality. Schenkerian analysis has proven itself to be an
extremely useful tool for analyzing tonal music, and Steve Larson’s pioneering
work in applying its methods to jazz has undoubtedly expanded the field of
jazz studies and brought jazz analysis into the theoretical mainstream. While
theorists may disagree on exactly \emph{how} we should apply these Schenkerian
techniques, hardly anyone seems to doubt that they are the best way to examine
tonal structures in jazz.

The touchstone of this literature is Steve Larson’s \emph{Analyzing Jazz: A
Schenkerian Approach}, which is the culmination of his work of the previous
decades.\fn{ta-1} In this and all of his work, Larson advocates what might be
called an “orthodox” Schenkerian approach. He treats the extended tones
common in jazz (sevenths, ninths, elevenths, etc.) as standing in for tonic
members at some deeper structural level.\footcite[6]{larson:2009} In doing so,
he is following the work of Steven Strunk, whose important article on linear
intervallic patterns in jazz also uses an orthodox
approach.\footcite{strunk:1996} Other theorists favoring the orthodox approach
include Daniel Arthurs, David Heyer, and Mark McFarland.\fn{ta-2}

At levels close to the background, these orthodox analyses of jazz do not
appear significantly different than analyses of classical music, and indeed
that is part of their appeal.\fn{ta-3} Because most jazz is basically tonal
music, these theorists are interested in showing its connection to the
European classical tradition by using the same techniques to analyze both of
them. This is especially important to note, since Schenkerian analysis has a
well-known ethical component.\footcite{cook:1989} For Schenker, the
compositions that were well-described by his theory were judged by him to be
masterworks. % xxx citation needed...
By showing that jazz compositions can also be understood with these
Schenkerian techniques, the implicit conclusion is that they too should be
judged to be masterworks. Underlying these orthodox approaches, I think, is a
desire to legitimize a place for jazz in academic music theory.

An opposing group of theorists also supports the use of Schenkerian analysis,
but argues that it should be adapted to account for tonal features specific to
jazz. Principal among this group is Henry Martin, who advocates for the use of
alternative \emph{Ursätze} in jazz, including ascending or gapped
\emph{Urlinien}, non-triadic descents, and chromatic or neighbor-note
\emph{Urlinien}.\fn{ta-4} He argues that jazz pieces are “often influenced by
a more African-American aesthetic that favors repetition and rhythmic
interplay over voice-leading motion through descending linear progressions,”
and thus we should not feel obligated to adhere to traditional Schenkerian
techniques.\footcite[7]{martin:2011}

Martin draws in part on James McGowan’s “dialects of consonance” in jazz,
which defines different contextually stable notes of the tonic triad.\fn{ta-5}
McGowan argues that consonance in jazz is stylistically defined, and that in
certain styles we might hear extended tones as consonances, even though they
would be dissonant in classical music. He lists three “principal dialects”:
the added sixth, common in early jazz and Tin Pan Alley standards; the minor
seventh, particular to the blues; and the major seventh, common in later jazz
performance.\fn{ta-6} For Schenker, the background is derived from the
consonant tonic triad; Martin is able use these stylistically determined
definitions of consonance as support for his stylistically informed background
structures.

McGowan’s work is among the minority in recent years that does not feature a
Schenkerian bent; in addition to his dialects of consonance, he is interested
in applying (paleo-) Riemannian functional analysis to jazz.\fn{ta-7} Despite
this Riemannian focus, however, he is not interested in transformational
analysis: David Lewin’s name appears nowhere in his bibliography.
% xxx definitely need more on bishop
Closer to my own interests is John Bishop’s 2012 dissertation, which also
turns to transformations and mathematical group theory to close the gap
between jazz pedagogy and jazz theory.\footcite{bishop:2012} Bishop focuses
primarily on the interplay of pure triads in jazz, and connects harmony to
chord-scales via these triads.

Other important non-Schenkerian models of jazz harmony are found in earlier
works of Martin and Strunk. In his dissertation, Martin advocates a syntactic
approach based on the circle of fifths, in which chains of decending fifths
point towards a tonic note.\fn{ta-8} Steven Strunk’s early theory of jazz
harmony is a layered approached that draws on the Schenkerian concept of
analytical levels to uncover a single tonal center for a jazz
tune.\footcite{strunk:1979} These older models tend to fall more in line with
how jazz musicians themselves discuss harmony, and we will return to them
below.\fn{ta-9}

Given the prevalence of Schenkerian techniques in jazz analysis and its proven
explanatory power in other tonal repertories, it is reasonable to ask why a
different approach like transformational theory is useful or necessary. In
order to answer this question, I would first like to problematize the
Schenkerian focus of recent jazz analysis. Steve Larson’s “Schenkerian
Analysis of Modern Jazz: Questions about Method” will serve as a useful foil;
it is one of the fundamental articles in the field, and its titular questions
will help to guide the discussion here.\fn{ta-10}

In the article, Larson asks three main questions we must answer if we are to
take seriously the suggestion that such Schenkerian analysis is appropriate
for jazz:

\begin{enumerate}
  \singlespacing
  \item Is it appropriate to apply to improvised music a method of analysis
    developed for the study of composed music?
  \item Can features of jazz harmony (ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths) not
    appearing in the music Schenker analyzed be accounted for by Schenkerian
    analysis?
  \item Do improvising musicians really intend to create the complex
    structures shown in Schenkerian analysis?\footcite[210]{larson:1998}
\end{enumerate}

Larson’s answer to the first question is yes. Many of Schenker’s own methods
were of course developed for improvisatory music, and even if they had not
been, they have proven to be explanatory for such music.\fn{ta-11} I agree
with Larson on this point, and don’t have anything in particular to add.
Certainly we should not expect that our theories can only prove useful for the
music for which they are designed; in fact as theorists we generally hope that
the opposite is true, and that our theories have broader applications than
originally imagined!

The second question has generated much more discussion in the literature
regarding exactly how we might apply Schenkerian methods to jazz, already
discussed above. While this discussion is mostly one of the mechanics of
analysis, it raises another point in which I am interested: is a jazz
musician’s conception of musical space, or musical structure, the same as a
classical musician’s? The orthodox Schenkerians argue that it is not, and that
jazz is a fundamentally triadic music (since at some deep structural level all
of the extended tones are reduced away). Those that favor a modified approach
disagree with this characterization, but still agree that Schenkerian analysis
is the best way to understand jazz harmony. My own reactions to this question
overlap with my answer to Larson’s third question, so I will return to it
shortly.

Larson’s third question regards compositional or improvisational intent. The
argument is perhaps obvious: because Schenkerian analysis depends on
uncovering long-range voice-leading plans, how could improvising musicians
possibly hold such plans in their memory while playing? At some level, we
might not even be interested in the answer to this question. Schenkerian
analysis has proven explanatory, after all, for music that was composed
indisputably without Schenkerian methods in mind (music written before
Schenker’s birth). Nevertheless, Larson spends a great deal of time addressing
this particular point, so we should see to it here as well.

After dismissing the possible intentional fallacy of this question, Larson
turns to pianist Bill Evans as an example of how a jazz musician could produce
complicated long-range voice-leading patterns while improvising. To do so, he
relies heavily on an interview that Bill Evans gave on Marian McPartland’s
radio program, \emph{Piano Jazz}.\fn{ta-12} Evans discusses how he always has
a basic structure in mind while playing:
\begin{quoting}
  \singlespacing
  McPartland: Well, when you say structure, you mean like, one chorus in a
  certain style, another\ldots

  \vspace{\baselineskip} \noindent
  Evans: No, I’m talking about the abstract, architectural thing, like the
  theoretical thing.\footcite[219]{larson:1998}
\end{quoting}
Evans goes on to demonstrate how he has certain structural features in mind
(harmonic and melodic arrivals). Larson then shows how Evans’s accompanying
commentary can be understood as explaining  voice-leading events like
prolongation and linear progressions, and provides voice-leading analyses of
his playing.\footcite[See especially the table in][229]{larson:1998}.

I think that Larson’s use of Schenker’s methods to analyze the music of Bill
Evans is well justified, but I am less sure of the extent to which they are
applicable to jazz more generally. Larson anticipates this objection, noting
that it might be offered on two grounds: “first, that Evans was unusually
talented as an improvisor; and second, that his way of thinking was radicially
different from that of other jazz musicians.”\footcite[239]{larson:1998}
Certainly Evans was not a typical jazz musician: he was white, and studied at
the Mannes College of Music, then and now a cradle of Schenkerian activity in
this country.\fn{ta-13} Larson suggests that Evans’s was such an influential pianist
that his Schenkerian improvisational tendencies might have influenced other
musicians with whom he played. While this may be true, Evans was probably
not seen as influential until after 1960, and this study is concerned
primarily with music before that time (or at least, with musicians whose style
was well established by that time).\fn{ta-14}

Larson allows that the first objection is justified: “That Evans was an
unusually talented improvisor---and that Schenkerian analysis can show
this---is a principle argument of this article.”\footcite[239]{larson:1998}
This statement is representative of the legitimizing enterprise of the
application of Schenker’s methods to jazz discussed above. It also contains a
dangerous implication, made explicit in Larson’s closing paragraphs:
\begin{quoting}
  \singlespacing
  Much jazz improvisation lacks the relationships that reward long-range
  hearing, and consists, as Hodeir observes, of “disconnected bits of
  nonsense.” \ldots\ But the fact that jazz musicians often say that “a jazz
  improvisation should tell a story” suggests that many jazz musicians are
  concerned with creating and experiencing global relationships. That they do
  not always achieve this goal in performance is not surprising---the task is
  difficult. But there are exceptions.

  Is Schenkerian analysis applicable only to jazz performances that are
  exceptions? No, Schenkerian analysis may be applied to any jazz
  performance---and it may show the shortcomings of that
  performance.\footcite[240--41]{larson:1998}
\end{quoting}

Far from “retaining Schenker’s methods but not his epistemology, his specific
insights into music but not the system of beliefs that supported them” (as
Nicholas Cook suggests that modern Schenkerians often do), Larson seems to be
using Schenkerian analysis to judge certain performances as “masterworks” and
others as inferior, much in the way done by Schenker
himself.\footcite[439]{cook:1989} Performances by musicians who do not share
Evans’s interest in the “abstract, architectural thing” may well be excellent
performances when judged by other value systems.\fn{ta-15}  Furthermore,
Schenkerian analyses of jazz often focus on what turns out to be the least
interesting part of a jazz piece. Jazz is essentially tonal music, so it is
not at all surprising (to me, at least) that it is often possible to uncover
an \emph{Ursatz} from a particular performance.

Whether or not jazz musicians are thinking in a Schenkerian manner is not
really the point, however. As Steven Rings puts it in the introduction to his
book, “any analytical act will \ldots\ leave a surplus---a vast, unruly realm
of musical experience that eludes the grasp of [a] single analytical model.
Corners of that vast realm may nevertheless be illuminated via other
analytical approaches, but those approaches will leave their own surpluses.
And so on.”\footcite[5]{rings:2011} Schenkerian analysis typically focuses on
long-range voice leading in order to reveal an underlying diatonic framework,
while deemphasizing (some would say reducing) sufrace details, including much
harmonic chromaticism.

This focus on harmony as a first-class object is something that is at the
heart of much jazz pedagogical material, and might help constitute a different
set of analytical values by which we can understand jazz. Rather than having
to consign musicians who we cannot understand with Schenkerian analysis to a
second tier of appreciation, we can instead try to understand them on
something of their own terms. A Schenkerian analysis of Coltrane’s “Giant
Steps” solo might reveal that it is “lacking an artistically convincing
relationship among structural levels,” but it would likely be difficult to
find a jazz musician who did not hold it up as an example of Coltrane’s
artistry.\fn{ta-16}

\section{Transformational Theory}
\label{sec:transformational-theory} %{{{

Given the current dominance of Schenkerian theory in the jazz harmonic
landscape, we might ask what transformational thinking brings to the table.
Transformational theory in recent years has focused on neo-Riemannian
analysis, with particular emphasis on efficient voice leading and
non-functional, chromatic progressions. Steven Rings has written that this
focus on neo-Riemannian theory has “led to a view that some works are divvied
up into some music that is tonal \ldots\ and some that is transformational.”
Continuing, he argues that to do so “is to misconstrue the word
transformational, treating it as a predicate for a certain kind of music,
rather than as a predicate for a certain style of analytical and theoretical
thought.”\footcite[9]{rings:2011} As he is right to point out, there is
nothing about transformational theory that necessitates its restriction to
this locally chromatic music; his book uses the theory to explain, as he says,
“specifically \emph{tonal} aspects of tonal music.” It is this meaning of
“transformational” that I wish to bring to bear on jazz, which is essentially
tonal music.

Fundamental to the Schenkerian approach is the relatively equal balance of
harmony and voice leading, as mentioned above; for jazz musicians, though,
this balance is heavily weighted toward the harmonic.  Schenkerian analysis
tends to deemphasize certain harmonies with the aim of exposing an underlying
diatonic framework. This goal is in contrast with the typical goal of a
performing jazz musician, for whom individual chords have first-class status.

Transformational theory too, often treats harmonies as first-class objects,
and thus makes it especially appropriate for analyzing jazz. “Often,” only
because transformational theory can be used for more than simply examining
harmony: Lewin’s Generalized Interval Systems (explained in detail below) only
require a set of elements, a group of intervals, and a function mapping pairs
of elements of the set into the group of intervals.\footcite[26]{lewin:gmit}
Most commonly the elements of the set are harmonies, but they do not have to
be.\fn{tt-1}

Mathematical music theories have become especially widespread in recent
years.\fn{tt-2} Many of these models focus on only on triads; while these
models are valuable, nearly all chords in jazz are seventh chords (at least).
Because the neo-Riemannian literature is relatively well-known, it will be
useful here to limit our focus to those theories that deal in some way with
non-triadic music. This work falls basically into two categories: work
that deals exclusively with a single type of chord, and work that deals with
musical objects of different types.
