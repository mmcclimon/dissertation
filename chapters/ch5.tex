The discussion of chord-scale transformations in the previous chapter
concludes the theoretical portion of this dissertation; this final chapter
will synthesize this theoretical framework in a series of three longer
analyses. All three of the tunes here---Thelonious Monk's ''Rhythm-a-ning,''
Sonny Stitt's ``The Eternal Triangle,'' and George Coleman's ``Lo-Joe''---are
instances of a harmonic archetype known as ``rhythm changes,'' named from
their origin in George Gershwin's ``I Got Rhythm.''\fn{rcg-1} Because tunes
that use Rhythm changes all share a common harmonic origin, they are an ideal
means to investigate jazz harmony. A complex set of standard substitutions and
harmonic patterns have emerged over the many years jazz musicians have been
playing rhythm changes; the three analyses in this chapter will allow us to
compare these musicians' manipulation of the basic harmonic framework.

\section{Rhythm Changes in General}
\label{sec:rhythm-changes-general}

It is hard to overestimate the influence of Rhythm changes on jazz practice;
along with the blues, it is one of the most common harmonic types in the bebop
era and beyond.\footcite[13]{owens:1995} David Baker lists more than 150
rhythm tunes in \emph{How to Learn Tunes}; some of the most well-known
of these are reproduced in Table
\ref{rcg:rhythm-tunes}.\footcite[42--44]{baker:tunes} Before moving on to the
three analyses in the following sections, it will be useful to examine the
form itself, along with some of its more common substitutions.

\subsection{Substitution Sets}
\label{subsec:substitution-sets}

``I Got Rhythm'' is, like many jazz standards, a 32-bar AABA form; the basic
progression is shown in Figure \ref{rcg:rhythm-basic}.\fn{rcg-2} As Andy Jaffe
notes, its changes are ``not the least bit astonishing''; the tune is a fairly
basic set of turnarounds and dominant cycles.\footcite[149]{jaffe:1996}
Indeed, this feature is one of the reasons for its popularity: the harmonic
framework is something of a blank slate, and allows room for alteration in a
way that more specific sets of changes (Parker's ``Blues for Alice,'' for
example) do not. Another thing that is immediately apparent is the quick
harmonic rhythm in the A sections, which allows soloists the opportunity to
show off as they navigate the rapidly moving changes.\fn{rcg-3}

\end{figure}

The ``mix-and-match'' aspect of harmonic progression is crucially important to
the genre of Rhythm tunes.\fn{rcg-4} Mark Levine explains the problem
nicely:%
%
\begin{quoting}
  \singlespacing
  When a musician calls a Rhythm tune like ``Oleo,'' there's no discussion of
  which version of the changes to play. As with the blues, jazz musicians
  freely mix many versions of Rhythm changes on the spot, as they improvise.
  Playing Rhythm changes is a little like knowing several tunes and playing
  them all at once; that's why ``Rhythm'' tunes are harder to play at first
  than a tune with only a single set of changes.\footcite[241]{levine:1995}
\end{quoting}
%
Given this background, we will proceed with the analytical discussion in
segments: the A sections can each be broken into four-bar halves, while the
bridge is typically treated as a single eight-bar unit.

The first four bars of the Rhythm A section serve to prolong the tonic \Bflat;
Figure \ref{rcg:rc-first-four} gives a number of possible harmonizations of
this section.\fn{rcg-5} Letter \emph{a} gives the original Rhythm changes,
while letter \emph{b} shows what is by far the most common substitution,
substituting \h{Dm7} for \h{Bb} in the third bar; this replaces the
I--vi--ii--V turnaround in the last two bars with a iii--vi--ii-V instead. If
the \h{Bb} harmony is voiced with a major seventh and major ninth
(\Bflat--D--F--A--C, a very common voicing), then we can understand the
substitution of \h{Dm7} as a simple omission of the root. Letter \emph{c}
transforms many of the minor seventh chords into dominant sevenths that lead
more strongly into the following harmonies.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centerGraphic{eps/ch5/rc-first-four-space.pdf}
  \caption{The first four bars of Rhythm changes in \tf space.}
  \label{rcg:rc-first-four-space}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{rcg:rc-first-four-space} shows the relevant portion of \tf space
for these first three harmonizations, along with a few annotations. The
standard harmonization of figure \ref{rcg:rc-first-four}a can be seen by
following the blue arrows. The substitution of \h{Dm7} in letter \emph{b} is
represented in the space by the red arrows: in this reading, first follow the
blue arrows until arriving at \h{F7}, then follow the red arrows until \h{Gm7}
where the blue arrows continue to the tonic \h{Bb}. The minor-to-dominant
substitutions of letter \emph{c} are not shown in the space, but are easy
enough to imagine: both \h{Gm7} and \h{Dm7} are transformed by the
\textsc{3rd}$^{-1}$ operation, and each is replaced by the chord immediately
to its north in \tf space (a substitution which results in the transformation
\mbox{\h{G7} \ECarrow\ \h{Cm7}} across the bar lines at the end of mm.~1 and
3).

The harmonization in Figure \ref{rcg:rc-first-four}d is still more complex.
The tritone substitution of \h{Db7} for \h{G7} in m.~3 is by now familiar, but
the \h{G7} in m.~2 has been replaced with a passing diminished seventh chord.
As we first saw in the analysis of ``Have You Met Miss Jones?'' in Section
\ref{subsec:miss-jones}, fully-diminished sevenths in jazz can be understood
as \h{V7b9} chords missing their roots. The \h{Bo7} here, then, is a logical
substitution for \h{G7b9}, and the \h{Cso7} in the following bar can be
understood as the same substitution of an implied \h{A7b9} chord (the dominant
of the following D minor), resulting in a chromatically ascending bass line in
the first two bars. Miles Davis's composition ``The Serpent's Tooth'' (the
opening of which is shown in Figure \ref{rcg:serpents-tooth}) uses a variation
of this progression. Davis also includes a minor-third substitution in m.~4,
substituting \h{Ebm7}--\h{Ab7} for the diatonic \h{Cm7}--\h{F7}.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centerGraphic{eps/ch5/serpents-tooth.pdf}
  \caption{``The Serpent's Tooth'' (Miles Davis), mm.~1--4.}
  \label{rcg:serpents-tooth}
\end{figure}

The last two harmonizations in Figure \ref{rcg:rc-first-four} are somewhat
different in nature; while any of the substitutions of letters
\emph{a}--\emph{d} can be swapped in and out at will, those in letters
\emph{e}--\emph{f} usually appear as units. Letter \emph{e} harmonizes the
first four bars with a simple cycle of dominant seventh chords (a favorite
technique of Thelonious Monk, and one we will see in the analysis of
``Rhythm-a-ning'' below). In contrast to the relatively compact arrangement of
letters \emph{a}--\emph{c} in \tf space, this cycle traverses nearly the
entire space before arriving at the tonic \h{Bb}.\fn{rcg-6} Letter \emph{f} is
the harmonization from Jimmy Heath's composition ``C.T.A.,'' and features a
lament-bass pattern from \h{Bb} down to \h{F7}, repeated twice.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centerGraphic{eps/ch5/rc-next-four.pdf}
  \caption{Several harmonizations of Rhythm changes, mm.~5--8.}
  \label{rcg:rc-next-four}
\end{figure}

The last four bars of the Rhythm A section contain a shift to the subdominant
in the first two bars, followed by a turnaround in the last two; Figure
\ref{rcg:rc-next-four} gives several common harmonizations of this passage.
Once again, letter \emph{a} reproduces the original changes; a seventh is
added to the tonic \Bflat, tipping it towards an \Eflat that resolves plagally
(via minor iv) back to tonic before a standard vi--ii--V turnaround. This
plagal motion in the second bar is often substituted with a backdoor
progression, as seen in \emph{b} (which also precedes the \h{Bb7} in the first
bar with its own \ii) and \emph{d} (which elides the \h{Eb} and \h{Ebm}
harmonies). Letter \emph{c} makes the substitution of \h{Dm7} for \h{Bb} in
the third bar, as seen in Figure \ref{rcg:rc-first-four}, and includes
\h{Eo7} as a substitution for \h{Eb7b9}.\fn{rcg-7}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centerGraphic{eps/ch5/rc-bridge.pdf}
  \caption{Several harmonizations of the Rhythm bridge, mm.~17--24.}
  \label{rcg:rc-bridge}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centerGraphic{eps/ch5/rc-bridge-space.pdf}
  \caption{Rhythm bridge harmonizations in \tf space.}
  \label{rcg:rc-bridge-space}
\end{figure}

The Rhythm bridge is usually recognizable because of the drastic slowing of
the harmonic rhythm; again, Figure \ref{rcg:rc-bridge} gives several common
harmonizations, and Figure \ref{rcg:rc-bridge-space} shows them in \tf space.
The standard bridge (letter \emph{a}) is a simple cycle of dominants,
beginning on the III chord. The most common substitutions here are tritone
substitutions of every other chord, as shown in \emph{b}--\emph{c}. The other
common option is to insert \ii chord before each of the dominants, as shown in
\emph{d}, decomposing each $T_5$ transformation into TF $\bullet$ \textsc{3rd}.
(This procedure could of course be repeated with the tritone-substituted
versions in \emph{b}--\emph{c} as well.) Other less conventional
harmonizations are also possible; ``The Eternal Triangle'' and ``Lo-Joe'' both
use specialized bridges to which we will return in later sections.

It should be apparent from this discussion that Rhythm tunes can vary widely
in their harmonic particulars. Because of the mix-and-match aspect of their
construction, the chords used by an ensemble can change even over the course
of a single performance: a rhythm section might prefer one harmonization of
the bridge during a saxophone solo and opt for another during a piano solo,
for example. The harmonizations given in Figures \ref{rcg:rc-first-four},
\ref{rcg:rc-next-four}, and \ref{rcg:rc-bridge} have only begun to scratch the
surface; because most of the tune consists of turnarounds, any of the
countless possible turnarounds could be used instead.\fn{rcg-8} It is easy to imagine a
Rhythm tune that makes use of the descending minor-third turnaround of
Henderson's ``Isotope'' or fast-moving Coltrane changes over the bridge.
