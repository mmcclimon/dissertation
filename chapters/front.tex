References to recordings in this dissertation are generally made only by
giving the performer’s name and album title; complete identifying information
can be found in the discography.

When discussing a particular piece of jazz, the words “piece,” “composition,”
and “work” all seem out of place. In general, I have adopted the word “tune”
to mean roughly “the basic structure of a work, including (primarily) its
melody and chord changes.” This is in keeping with the way jazz musicians use
the word: they may refer to a ``16-bar tune,'' a “rhythm changes tune,” or “one
of my favorite tunes” (all referring to the abstract structure of the tune and
not simply the melody). When I am referencing a \emph{particular}
instantiation of a work (e.g.~Bill Evans’s recording of “Autumn Leaves” from
\emph{Portrait in Jazz}), I will make that clear.

In running text, dominant seventh chords are indicated with just a “\h{7},”
major sevenths with “\h{M7},” minor sevenths with “\h{m7},” and
half-diminished sevenths with “\h{m7b5}”. In a minor key the tonic chord is
often played with a major seventh, which is indicated “\h{mM7}.” The
progression \h{Dm7}--\h{G7}--\h{CM7} thus indicates a D minor seventh moving
to a G dominant seventh moving to a C major seventh chord. In examples, chord
symbols typically follow conventions used by \emph{The Real Book}.

There are two ways mathematicians notate function composition: left-to-right
and right-to-left. When combining two functions, $f\,$ followed $g$,
right-to-left orthography writes $g(f\,(x))$, while left-to-right orthography
writes $(fg)(x)$. Right-to-left orthography is familiar to most readers, and
we will use it when talking about transformations as functions: statements of
the form $f\,(x)$ should be read from right to left. (David Lewin uses
left-to-right notation throughout \emph{Generalized Musical Intervals and
Transformations}.) When discussing strings of transformations, however,
right-to-left orthography can be confusing: $L(P\,(x))$ indicates the $P$
operation applied to some object $x$, followed by the $L$ operation (it is
easy to see how the problem can proliferate when there are multiple operations
involved). To get around this problem, we will use left-to-right orthography
denoted by the symbol $\odot$; the operation $P\,$ followed by the operation
$L$ is notated $P \odot L$.\footnote{This use follows that of Julian Hook; see
\headlesscite[Section 2.3]{hook:mst}.} This combination of notation seems
intuitive, but we will be explicit in situations where the orthography may be
confusing.
