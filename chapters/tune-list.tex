\chapter*{List of Recordings}

This appendix provides a list of all of the musical examples used in this
dissertation, along with recordings where they can be found. For each tune, I
have tried to provide at least two standard interpretations; they have been
chosen because they present clear statements of the standard changes analyzed
in the text. Recordings are listed here only by the artist and album title;
full details can be found in the discography that follows.
