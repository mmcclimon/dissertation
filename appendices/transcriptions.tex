% xxx Write something about transcription generally here
Transcription is a notoriously difficult problem in jazz. As Steve Larson
(among others) has noted, any transcription is also, in some sense, an
analysis.\footcite[2]{larson:2009} In the transcriptions that follow, I have
(in general) only notated the solo line, focusing primarily on the pitches and
rhythms. This means that many of the so-called ``secondary parameters'' are
absent from the notation: dynamics, intonation, phrasing, issues of timing,
etc. To that end, the transcriptions should be seen as companions to the
source recordings, not replacements for them.

In the transcriptions of the rhythm changes tunes, no chord symbols are given.
One of the principal arguments of Chapter 5 is that the chord symbols are
somewhat fluid through the course of a performance; I have simply omitted the
chord symbols rather than assigning one based on the solo line. In the
transcriptions, the notes remain more-or-less uninterpreted (though the
notation of accidentals is a question of interpretation); examples in the text
refer to a given passage's harmonic context.

\noindent There are a few other minor things to note:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Formal designations follow Larson's convention: $2\mathrm{A}_3$ refers
    to the third A section of the second chorus, $4\mathrm{B}$ refers to the B
    section of the fourth chorus, and so on. Timestamps from the reference
    recording are given at the beginning of each chorus.
  \item Throughout, the tenor saxophone is notated at concert pitch but sounds
    down an octave, and soprano saxophone is notated at pitch.
  \item ``X'' noteheads indicate either ghosted notes (which are much lower in
    volume than surrounding notes) or alternate fingerings for the same pitch
    (a timbral effect often used in the high register by saxophonists).
\end{compactitem}

    The head changes for this recording are as given in Figure
    \ref{ds:autumn-leaves-complete}, but the solo changes shown here are
    slightly different. The third and fourth bars of each A section consistently
    substitute \h{Emaj7}--\h{Bbmaj7} for \h{Bbmaj7}--\h{Ebmaj7}, and the
    progression \h{Gm7}--\h{C7}--\h{Fm7}--\h{Bb7} in the third and fourth bars
    of the C sections appear here as \h{Gm7}--\h{Em7b5}.}

    The album gives Kirk's name only as Roland Kirk; he added
    Rahsaan to his name in 1969. Kirk often played multiple instruments
    simultaneously; the transcription tries to make this clear, providing a
    separate staff for each instrument. The ``manzello'' is a modified soprano
    saxophone (both names are given here).}
